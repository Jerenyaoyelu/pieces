## what have done

- [x] generate embeddings with python scripts when consuming a next api endpoint (currently locally)
- [x] host onnx model file in cloud with Aliyun OSS
- [x] host generated embedding npy files in cloud with Aliyun OSS
- [x] tackle the cors issue of uploaded npy files
- [x] tackle the host issue of sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth file
- [x] put all pieces together and make the app run
- [x] support uploading image

## what to do

- [ ] support extracting specific piece of image
- [ ] cooler interaction with each piece
- [ ] refact: support local host onnx model
- [ ] refact: support local generate and store embedding files with uploaded image eliminating any process with cloud.

> warning: Downloading fee generated by aliyun oss is significant, therefore the refactor is a must to do.
