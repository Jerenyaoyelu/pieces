🔥 A web utility case of Segmenting images using Meta AI's SAM.

> Under construction, more features are coming...

## what have done

- [x] generate embeddings with python scripts when consuming a next api endpoint (currently locally)
- [x] host onnx model file in cloud with Aliyun OSS
- [x] host generated embedding npy files in cloud with Aliyun OSS
- [x] tackle the cors issue of uploaded npy files
- [x] tackle the host issue of sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth file
- [x] put all pieces together and make the app run
- [x] support uploading image

## what to do

- [ ] support extracting specific piece of image
- [ ] cooler interaction with each piece
- [ ] refact: support local host onnx model
- [ ] refact: support local generate and store embedding files with uploaded image eliminating any process with cloud.

> warning: Downloading fee generated by aliyun oss is significant, therefore the refactor is a must to do.

## Tips

- netlify 构建环境 python 配置环境有问题，python3 脚本执行会抛出 ENOENT 错误
- 可以使用 netlify function 或者 docker 保持本地和生产一直的环境来解决这个问题
- 这里暂时采用 netlify function 方法（netlify 不直接支持部署 Docker 容器）
